# What is Scikit-Learn?

Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. Itâ€™s built upon some of the technology you might already be familiar with, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib!

The functionality that scikit-learn provides include:

Regression, including Linear and Logistic Regression
Classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors
Clustering, including K-Means and K-Means++
Model selection
Preprocessing, including Min-Max Normalization


# Decision Tree in Machine Learning

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to model and predict outcomes based on input data. It is a tree-like structure where each internal node tests on attribute, each branch corresponds to attribute value and each leaf node represents the final decision or prediction. The decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problems.

# Common APIs for scikit learn classifiers

To create code using the scikit-learn package to build and test decision trees. Scikit-learn contains many simple sets of functions. In fact, except for the second line of code that you can see in the following screenshot, which is specifically about decision trees, we will use the same functions for other classifiers as well, such as random forests:
